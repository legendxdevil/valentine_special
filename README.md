## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: A "Yes" button and a "No" button that trigger different responses.
- **Cute Cat Images**: Randomly changes cat images when the "No" button is clicked.
- **Playful Messages**: Displays different messages based on how many times the "No" button is clicked.
- **Button Escape**: The "No" button moves around the screen after multiple clicks to make it harder to click.
- **Final Response**: When the "Yes" button is clicked, a heartfelt message is displayed, and the buttons are disabled.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Screen**: The page displays a cute cat image and asks, "Will you be my Valentine, Pookie? ‚ù§Ô∏è".
2. **Clicking "No"**:
   - The first click shows: "Aisa mat karo, Pookie! üò¢".
   - The second click shows: "Please think again! ü•∫".
   - The third click shows: "Please think again, Pookie! üò≠".
   - After the third click, the "No" button starts moving randomly around the screen.
   - Each click also changes the cat image randomly.
3. **Clicking "Yes"**:
   - Displays: "I love you too, Pookie! ‚ù§Ô∏è".
   - Changes the cat image to a random "job bitch" image.
   - Disables both buttons.
